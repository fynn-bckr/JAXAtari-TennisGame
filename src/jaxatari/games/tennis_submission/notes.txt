Initially our plan was to simply fix the existing partial implementation of the tennis game.
However, since progress in fixing the problems related to the physics of the game was too slow and overall inefficient, we
decided to start rewriting the game once more. Working with a smaller codebase made it significantly easier to create
a decent approximation of the original game's ball behaviour. Because of our decision to start from scratch we were not able
to implement as many parts of the game as we hoped, but now that we have a vastly improved understanding of the game's physics
we feel confident that we can build an accurate recreation of the original game.
